  "readme": "Mobile Data service SDK for IBM Bluemix\r\n===\r\n\r\nBlueMix supports IBM's MobileFirst strategy by allowing you as a mobile developer to quickly incorporate pre-built, managed, and scalable cloud services into your mobile applications without relying on IT involvement. You can focus on building your mobile applications rather than the complexities of managing the back end infrastructure.\r\n\r\nWhen you create a Mobile Cloud Starter application, BlueMix provisions multiple services under a single application context. Your mobile application is given access to the following mobile services: Mobile Application Security, Push, and Mobile Data.\r\n\r\nAbout\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe Data Service SDK is a JavaScript SDK you can use inside a Web or Hybrid application.  You can also use the SDK inside a server-side [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) JavaScript module. The SDK manages all the persistance and querying of data with the IBM Bluemix Mobile Cloud.\r\n\r\n## Download\r\n\r\n### Node.js\r\n\r\nInstall the `ibmdata` package with the [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.org/) package manager , this will require [`node.js`](http://nodejs.org/download/) to be installed first.\r\n\r\nUse the following command to install the SDK:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nnpm install ibmdata\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Web or Hybrid\r\n\r\nInstall the `ibmdata` package with the [`bower`](http://bower.io/) package manager with the following command:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbower install https://hub.jazz.net/git/bluemixmobilesdk/ibmdata-javascript/.git\r\n```\r\n\r\nSDK Getting Started Guide\r\n--\r\n\r\nTo find out more information about using the SDK, see the\r\n[Mobile Cloud Services SDK Developer Guide](http://mbaas-gettingstarted.ng.bluemix.net/).\r\n\r\n\r\nServices\r\n--\r\n\r\nEach of the services for the JavaScript SDK is in a separate module that you can add to your project individually.\r\n\r\nThis allows maximum flexibility to the developer to individually pick and choose the services that are key to the application. The JavaScript SDK contains the following services.\r\n\r\n- [ibmbluemix](https://hub.jazz.net/project/bluemixmobilesdk/ibmbluemix-javascript/overview)\r\n- [ibmcloudcode](https://hub.jazz.net/project/bluemixmobilesdk/ibmcloudcode-javascript/overview)\r\n- [ibmdata](https://hub.jazz.net/project/bluemixmobilesdk/ibmdata-javascript/overview)\r\n- [ibmpush](https://hub.jazz.net/project/bluemixmobilesdk/ibmpush-javascript/overview)\r\n\r\nEach one of these services can be added to your project.\r\nËœ\r\n",
