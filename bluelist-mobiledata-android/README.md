Sample: bluelist-mobiledata-android
===

The bluelist-mobiledata-android sample builds upon the bluelist-base-android sample, a simple grocery list application.  In bluelist-mobiledata-android, the items persist to a mobile backend, using the Mobile Data service.

This sample works with the Mobile Cloud, an application boilerplate that is available on [IBM Bluemix](https://www.ng.bluemix.net).  With this boilerplate, you can quickly incorporate pre-built, managed, and scalable cloud services into your mobile applications without relying on IT involvement. You can focus on building your mobile applications rather than the complexities of managing the back end infrastructure.

This sample uses the Mobile Data service that is a part of the Mobile Cloud boilerplate.  After you run the sample and add some items to the list, you can see your data persisted to the cloud.
